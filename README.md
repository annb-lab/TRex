This repo accompanies the research article "Deep-mutational scanning libraries using tiled-region exchange mutagenesis" by Kortni Kindree*, Claire A. Chochinov*, Keerath Bhachu*, Yunyi Cheng , Amelia Caron, Molly McDonald, Zaynab Mamai, Alex N. Nguyen Ba& (2025)

It contains example pipelines for:

    Identifying suitable tiling locations for T-Rex
    Producing all the oligo sequences for a comprehensive deep-mutational scanning experiment

The code is not expected to be readily functional to the user, as dependencies, paths and hardcoded values would need to be appropriately adjusted.

Supplementary files are included with the published research article.
